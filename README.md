# Business-Requirement
The DrivePass project required designing a system for a company aimed at improving driver training. The client, DrivePass, sought a system that manages various user roles, provides online and on-road training, and ensures secure data handling and accurate tracking of user activities. I think I did particularly well in defining clear objectives and goals, ensuring that all client requirements were throughtly understood and incorporated into the system design. I would revise the user interface design to enhance usability based on user feedback, ensuring that the system is not only functional but also intuitive and easy to navigate. Interpreting user needs involved detailed requirement gathering and creating user case and activity diagram to visualize uset interactions . Considering user needs is crucial fro desiging a system that is both effective and user-friendly, ultimately leading to higher satisfaction and better outcomes. My approach to designing software involves through requirement analysis, iterative design and prototyping, and constant user feedback integration. In the future, I would focuse more on user experience dedign and usability testing to ensure the system meets user expectations.
